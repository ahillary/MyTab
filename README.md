# MyTab

MyTab is a PWA for keeping track of shared expenses. Create a group, add friends, track your expenses, settle up.

MyTab can be found deployed on Heroku at https://mytab-ghp.herokuapp.com

MyTab is a Senior Phase project created by four software engineers at Fullstack Academy. We designed it using the popular app Spitwise as a template.

We choose to create a PWA so our app will be easily accessible on both mobile devices and desktop computers, while at the same time we were able to work on honing the skills we learned in Junior Phase.
Our main tech stack for MyTab is the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React-Redux, Node.js).
For styling we utilized CSS and Ant Design.
To handle money rendering we used currency.js.
Amazon OAuth was added for easy and secure account creation. Additionally, using Amazon starts the path towards adding a payment feature within the app.

This project was created during covid times, which means we never met in person. To help with group management we utilized GitHubâ€™s kanban board, zoom, and Slack.
